angular (webapp):
	npm install --global windows-build-tools			- install windows npm tools (just once!)
	npm install							- pull dependencies
	ng serve							- host

loopback:
	npm run build; npm run migrate			- run db migrations (update schema)
	npm start 								- build & start server
	http://localhost:3000/explorer/# 		- check endpoints
	
	lb4 datasource							- create datasource (connection to database)
	lb4 model								- create entity model that will be peristed
	lb4 relation							- create relation between models
	lb4 repository							- create repository to mark model as peristable to db
	lb4 controller							- create controller to perform basic CRUD operations

Notes:
Before you run migration for the 1st time make sure to create schema in your db (check server/src/datasources/main.datasource.json for more info).

Loopback - webapp communication:
To generate code needed to communicate with server use one of the sdk-update scripts.
Executed while server is running it will generate all necessary data and services needed to use endpoints from webapp.
Generated code is located in webapp/sdk.
